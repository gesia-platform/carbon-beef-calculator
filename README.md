## üìñ Overview
The Smart Contract-Based Footprint Calculator is a decentralized tool designed to estimate the carbon footprint associated with pete consumption. This smart contract operates on a blockchain platform and provides a straightforward way to calculate and retrieve carbon emission data from the blockchain.

## ‚ú® Features
**Calculate Carbon Footprint (Public)**: Users can calculate the carbon footprint from the set Beef carbon emission factor. This public function returns an estimate of the carbon footprint associated with the weight of the Beef.
